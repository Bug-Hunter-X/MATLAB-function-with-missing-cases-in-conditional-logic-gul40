This repository contains a MATLAB function with a bug and its corresponding solution. The original function has a flaw in its conditional logic, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. The corrected function handles all possible cases properly. This is an example that illustrates a common error in MATLAB code: insufficient handling of various cases in conditional statements. The solution emphasizes the importance of thorough testing and comprehensive case management for reliable functions.  Ensure your conditional statements consider all potential input scenarios to prevent unexpected behaviors.
